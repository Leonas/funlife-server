Most of the JS Core is based off of jqMobi but hundreds of errors have been fixed,
it has been rewritten to make it much clearer, and a new documentation has been written.

Read the documentation, then read the source. The source should be easy to understand.
If there are any mistakes or something isn't very clear, please fix it.

The CSS used is almost identical to Twitter's Bootstrap but its modified to work better on mobile.

The plan is to release the core as open source when we have made sure it works perfectly.
For now it is closed source copyright FunLife & respective owners.

Always update the documentation if the core has been modified.
